* Our focus was on designing a machine learning
model for <a href="https://www.f5.com/" target="_blank">F5 Networks</a> to predict version upgrade success chances by mapping logs and hardware data. 
We achieved this goal by implementing Term Frequency-Inverse
Document Frequency (tf-idf), Information Retrieval,
and Vector Space Modelling techniques.
